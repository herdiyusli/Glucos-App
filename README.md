<h3>Backgrounder</h3>
The COVID-19 pandemic has made every activity shift from offline to online. Work from home is one of the factors that make a person less physically active which increases a person's risk of diabetes. Diabetes is a dangerous disease with a very high mortality rate. It is caused by increased levels of glucose in the blood which overtime will cause a number of complications, including kidney failure, blindness and heart attack.  A Journal of Cell Metabolism found a very high proportion (49.7%) of patients with COVID-19 experienced hyperglycemia. hyperglycemia is a condition in which blood glucose levels exceed its normal limit. If this happens continuously, it will lead to diabetes. Based on this background, we are interested in creating a diabetes detection application so that people can be more aware of diabetes during the pandemic. This application can be useful as a prevention and early detection tool to find out the possibility of someone having diabetes.
